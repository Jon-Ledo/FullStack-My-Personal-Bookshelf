## Description

A web page designed to store book data, user data and reviews data in a SQL database, to be rendered on a browser for the user to interact with. The user will have the ability to look at a catalogue of books on the website, look at reviews for a book, add them to their own "personal bookshelf", as well as update and delete books and reviews.

## Installation

1. After downloading a copy of the repo, create the database in MySQL workbench using the schema that's found in the db folder

2. Setup the database connection now. Create a .env file and put the following code in it. However replace the contents of DB_USER and DB_PASSWORD to match your MySQL workbench information. (ex. 'root' and 'coolpassword123')

```
DB_NAME='bookshelf_db'
DB_USER='<your_user_here>'
DB_PASSWORD='<your_password_here>'
```

3. Once the database has been made, it's time to seed it with data. Return to your terminal (make sure you are in this projects working directory) and run the command:

```
npm run seed
```

4. After database has been seeded, it's time to run the server running the command:

```
node server.js
```

5. Navigate to POSTMAN, and start testing any endpoints for GET, POST, PUT and DELETE

```
localhost:3001/api/users
localhost:3001/api/users{id}
localhost:3001/api/books
localhost:3001/api/books/{id}
localhost:3001/api/reviews
localhost:3001/api/reviews/{id}
```
